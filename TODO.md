## Test Refactoring Tasks

- [ ] Convert fake repositories to Jest mocks
- [ ] Fix nullable patterns in FakeUserRepository
- [ ] Fix nullable patterns in FakeUserRoleRepository
- [ ] Fix nullable patterns in FakeQuestionRepository
- [ ] Fix nullable patterns in FakeBookmarkRepository
- [ ] Fix nullable patterns in fake services
- [ ] Refactor test files to use Jest mocks instead of fake implementations

## Completed Tasks

âœ… **Question Workflow Try-Catch Cleanup** - Removed unnecessary try-catch blocks from QuestionManager, BaseRepository, and QuestionMongooseDataSource. Code reduced by ~40%, error handling delegated to global appErrorHandler.

âœ… **Centralized Error Management System** - Implemented ApplicationError, removed CustomError, cleaned up all layers (controllers, managers, repositories, data sources), removed nullable patterns, standardized error handling across the entire application.
